# Introduction
Our proposed project, ‘Rent A Ride’ was for making car services easier for owners, drivers and 
users who work and commute on a daily basis. It is safe to say we have materialized most of 
our projects functionalities as we have implemented so far.

# Project Features

• Car Owner Login.
• User Login.
2. Car owner has to register for adding their cars to the services.
3. Car owner can add, modify and list their cars.
4. User can see the price plan for particular service.
5. User can choose his/her desirable car.
6. Users can book other services like airport, hourly and daily basis rent services.
7.Guest user can visit our website but cannot get renting services.

# Conclusion
Our project has been made so that the car owners can register their car and drivers can sign 
up to make this car rental service accessible to users. It is not perfected for some 
functionalities but it does provide smooth service depending on the services available
